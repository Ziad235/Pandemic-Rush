# Pandemic_Rush

Rules of the game:
- Your objective is to avoid as many covid viruses as you can.  
- You can move right, left, up, and down, while the covid viruses fall downwards from the stop of the screen.  
- Every 1 second you survive in the game, you gain 1 extra point.
- Every 100 points you earn, the level increases by 1, which is accompanied by a sound to let you know.
- There are 3 levels to the game:   
level 1 will have average-speed meteors falling vertically.  
level 2 will have more and larger meteors falling vertically with higher speeds than those in level 1.  
level 3 will add to level 2 by allowing meteors to be generated from the sides.
- There will be random “power ups” (surgical mask and hand sanitizer) that the
you can "hit" in order to increase the score.  
- The game ends when you reach 300 points (when you complete all 3 levels).
- The game will have a “High Score” bar to let you be able to beat a high score.
